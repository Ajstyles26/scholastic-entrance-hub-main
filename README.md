# Ajayi Crowther University Admission Portal

This repository now contains a simple static website built with plain HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript. All previous React and Node tooling has been removed.

## Getting started

No build steps are required. Simply open `static/index.html` in a browser to view the site.

## Customisation

Edit the files inside the `static/` directory to change the markup or styles.
